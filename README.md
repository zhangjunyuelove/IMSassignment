# IMSassignment
## Introduction
This is the codes for IMS assignment to measure different encoders' quality performance and encoding time with different bitrate<br>
## Preparation
1.Run it in Linux environment <br>
2.Download ffmpeg and ensure four encoders H.264 HEVC VP9 and AV1 can work in terminal <br>
3.Download the file in (http://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~iandreop/ffmpeg_static_with_VMAF.zip) and extract it for VMAF measurement <br>
4.The code should run through the path of file extracted <br>
5. Ensure the library matplot is included in python <br>
## Testing
1. Enter the video's whole file name and simplified name as you want<br>
2. Choose option1 to test three encoders together or option2 to test AV1 only<br>
3. Enter bitrate accordingly<br>
4. It will output the data<br>
